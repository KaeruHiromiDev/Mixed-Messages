# Mixed-Messages
My first project I'm doing through Codecademy. This is a really basic coding project that I have some ideas to improve if I come back to it. HTML page that displays the sentence on button press. Ability to enter your own words into the sentence. Option to choose what type of sentence you are making.

## Though Process

For this project I wanted to practice using objects so I made a sentence object with the different parts of the sentence inside it in arrays and creating methods for each function needed.
